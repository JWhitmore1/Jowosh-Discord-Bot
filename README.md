# Jowosh Discord Bot
The source code for a small project of working on a discord bot called Jowosh. This project is built using the [Hikari](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari) and [Lightbulb](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb) libraries 

## Invite

## Prerequisites
All the libraries required for the project can be found in the requirements.txt file and can be installed locally using:

## Running

```
bot_token = "<your token>"
```
